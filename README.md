# SentimentsAnalysis

In this project, we aim to perform sentiment analysis on a given text dataset, employing various natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset consists of texts with associated emotions, and we will use text cleaning and tokenization to preprocess the data before conducting sentiment analysis. The emotions included in the dataset are positive, negative, and neutral.

Project Workflow:

Data Collection:

Acquire the dataset containing texts with labeled emotions (positive, negative, and neutral). This dataset could be obtained from various sources, like social media, customer reviews, or other sentiment-labeled data repositories.

Text Cleaning:

Perform text cleaning to remove any unnecessary characters, special symbols, URLs, or mentions that may not add value to the sentiment analysis.Convert all text to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity during analysis.

Tokenization:

Tokenize the preprocessed text into individual words or tokens to prepare them for sentiment analysis.

Sentiment Analysis:

Utilize a pre-trained sentiment analysis model or train a sentiment analysis classifier on the cleaned and tokenized dataset.Assign each text a sentiment label: positive, negative, or neutral.

Bar Graph Visualization:

Create a bar graph to display the distribution of sentiments in the dataset.The x-axis will represent the emotions (positive, negative, neutral), and the y-axis will indicate the count of each sentiment in the dataset.

Twitter Sentiment Analysis:

Apply the trained sentiment analysis model on the tokenized tweets to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

Twitter Hashtag Sentiment Visualization:

Create a bar graph to display the distribution of sentiments for the Twitter hashtag.The x-axis will represent the emotions (positive, negative, neutral), and the y-axis will indicate the count of each sentiment in the tweets associated with the hashtag.

Tools and Libraries:

Python: The project will be implemented using Python programming language.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries: NLTK  for text processing and sentiment analysis.

Data Visualization: Matplotlib for creating bar graphs.


Conclusion:

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on a given dataset of texts with emotions and extends the analysis to Twitter hashtags to determine whether the sentiments expressed in tweets associated with specific hashtags are positive, negative, or neutral. The bar graphs will visually represent the sentiment distribution, providing valuable insights into the emotions conveyed by the text data and tweets related to specific hashtags.
